## Professional Goals 🚀
- **Career Development:** Focused on furthering my career in software development, specifically in roles that provide an opportunity for me to immerse myself in environments where I can gain exposure to best practices and technologies building impactful tech solutions.
- **Continuous Learning:** In my commitment to sustained professional development and my believe in teaching the things we know to understand what we don't, I have thus written several [articles](https://dev.to/joshraphael) on first-principle topics aimed at assisting professionals transitioning into tech 📈.
